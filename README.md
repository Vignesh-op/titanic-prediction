Titanic Prediction Workflow

Data Loading & Inspection

Import training and test datasets.

Explore key features like age, sex, fare, class, cabin, and embarkation port.

Visualize survival rates across different categories (e.g., survival by class or gender).

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handle missing values: e.g., fill the missing ages using median or prediction techniques, fill embarked with the mode, and handle missing fares.

Encode categorical variables:

Convert 'Sex' to numerical (e.g., male = 0, female = 1).

One-hot encode ports of embarkation.

Derive new features:

Title extraction from passenger names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.).

Family size (SibSp + Parch + 1).

Cabin presence (whether cabin info exists) or letter grouping.

Model Selection & Training

Split the training data into training and validation sets.

Possible models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (like XGBoost, LightGBM), or even simple Ensembles.

Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation or grid search.

Model Evaluation

Evaluate with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Display feature importances to interpret which variables matter most.

Prediction & Submission

Apply the trained model to the test set.

Generate a submission file with PassengerId and Survived (0 or 1).
